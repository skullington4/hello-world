# hello-world
Just another repository
Hello everyone,
My name is Kevin and I am new to GitHub. I am using GitHub to relearn java. Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.
I went to SUNY Brockport for Computer Information Systems. Since graduating, I got a job as a computer operator at Excellus BCBS.
While learning all the ins and outs of my current job, I became rusty in Java :(
Time to get back to what I enjoy most.
